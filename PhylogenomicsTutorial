#Phylogenomics


We will work with the orthogroups you have identified last week.
We will select subsets of them and obtain phylogenies for each of the sets to compare how the results and resolution of the analysis changes with the data that is used. 


##Data set selection and extraction of specific orthogroups



##Prepare alignments for the different sets



##Obtain a phylogeny using IQtree


##Interpret the results
